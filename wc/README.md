# Word Count #

This project is able to simply get a word count, byte count as well as a line count based on the echo input that you provide it.

### Flags ###

- **l** - Set this flag to get the line count

- **b** - Set this flag to get the byte count. **Note** This will override the line flag, as we only give an int count of the software

### Potential improvements ###

- More flags obviously
- Adding seperate counter output for the current flags
